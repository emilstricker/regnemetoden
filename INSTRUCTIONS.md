# Mathematical Weight Loss Method - Instructions

This document outlines a mathematical approach to weight loss that ensures steady and controlled progress.

## Basic Principles

1. The method is based on precise daily measurements and calculations
2. Progress is tracked through a systematic approach over a defined period
3. Weight loss is achieved through controlled daily deficits

## Getting Started

1. Record your starting weight in the evening after your last meal (e.g., 83.0 kg)
2. Set your target weight (e.g., 80.0 kg)
3. Decide on your timeline (e.g., 30 days)
4. Calculate your daily weight loss target based on these parameters

## Daily Process

Each day, follow these steps:

1. Weigh yourself in the morning
2. Calculate your daily food allowance:
   - Subtract your morning weight from your target weight for that day
   - This difference is what you can eat during the day
3. Plan your meals according to your calculated allowance

## Important Notes

- Weight loss will be strongest at the beginning
- Don't try to save up grams from day to day
- A lower metabolism will make weight loss more challenging
- It's crucial to hit your target weight exactly each day - neither over nor under
- A conservative pace is recommended to prevent burnout
- Example daily weight loss of 100g is more sustainable than higher amounts

## Example Calculation

Starting weight: 83.0 kg
Target weight: 80.0 kg
Duration: 30 days
Daily weight loss: 100g

Day 1 evening: 83.0 kg
Day 2 morning: 81.8 kg
Daily food allowance: 82.9 kg - 81.8 kg = 1.1 kg

## Tracking

Use a tracking sheet to record:
- Date
- Morning weight
- Daily food allowance
- Evening target weight

Following this method precisely will mathematically guarantee weight loss progress when adhered to correctly.
